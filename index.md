# REAL TIME ARBORETUM

## Introduction
This project combines three sensors to get the temperature, humidity and soil moisture levels of the surroundings and display it on the screen. 

## Sensors
These are the sensors we are using:
Chirp! Water sensor

## Febuary 1st ,2019
PCB is fully done and ready for soldering but we figured a problem at this point.

Socket Headers we are using have small pins but due to our massive wiring structure reqwuired for the working of sensor, This pcb required headers with long pins so that the soldering can be done from both sides
